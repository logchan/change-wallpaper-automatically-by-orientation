change-wallpaper-automatically-by-orientation
=============================================

Automatically change your wallpaper according to whether your tablet is Landscape or Portrait mode

### This program is no longer changed (unless a big bug is found. I mean really big), as it's successor, a WPF version, has come out. Find it [HERE](https://github.com/logchan/switch-wallpaper-and-lockscreen-automatically-when-rotating/)

###### If you are looking for a binary(executable) file (.exe), please refer to [Here](http://www.logu.co/dwas-en). 
###### 如果你需要一个可执行文件，请访问[这里](http://www.logu.co/dwas).

###### 平台/platform: .net framework 4.0

###### The winform part is not big deal. But you may be interested in the multilang library which provide a way to globalize your application.
